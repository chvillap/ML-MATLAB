# Machine Learning algorithms in MATLAB

Some machine learning algorithms that I implemented in MATLAB while I was taking [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), back in 2015.

The following algorithms/examples are included:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (two-class and one-vs-all)
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Principal Component Analysis
- K-Means
- Anomaly/Outlier Detection
- And several auxiliary functions (for plotting, preprocessing, evaluation, etc...)

As far as I'm aware, everything runs in Octave too.

Needless to say, but these implementations were written from scratch for learning purposes and so they are NOT meant to be used in real-world applications (I strongly recommend [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) for that).
